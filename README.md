This is my first responsive website! I followed along with Kevin Powell's fully 
responsive website Scrimba tutorial, which I highly recommend. His approach involves 
prompting the learner to attempt to solve the problem before giving the solution - 
I think this approach is just perfect. The course is about far more than just the 
technical aspects of website construction; I believe that the most valuable lessons 
in the course were related to how to approach the project and structure a website, 
building it according to figma layouts (good practice for working with a design team), 
with reusable components so that it's composable and decently organized.



Check out the project elements here:

The Space Tourism Website Project on Frontend Mentor: 
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3



The website itself is for a fictional space tourism agency. There are (4) pages: Home, 
Destinations, Crew, and All pages utilize a tab system within the page. Each 
page also has a Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop version, and all pages are fully responsive. 
Each layout includes a variety of components: images, text, and interactive components, 
and HTML, CSS and Javascript are all utilized, HTML and CSS throughout, and Javascript 
the mobile navigation bar and tab system functionalities. 

There's still room for improvement in the finished website.
